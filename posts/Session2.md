### Intro

Git is one of the most important tools a web developer can use. We want to introduce the learners to git as early in the course as possible as we will be using git when we complete challenges in the upcoming lessons. This is to help people get used to the concept and hopefully introduce git to their workflow if it isnâ€™t already

### Task 

To install Git and complete the git-it electron [challenge](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron)
