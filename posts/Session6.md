### Intro

This session will expose the learners to more information about git and how it works. This is very good practise as they will be fetching a repo onto their machine and making changes and uploading them via git. This is turn will update the static site on netlify which will also expose the students to a complete deployment process.

### Task 

Add Bootstrap elements to this site, using branches and making detailed commits

### Helpful links

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
